    <h1>Apple acquires V1Soft; current developers are laid off</h1>

    <p>Earlier this morning, Apple Inc. signed a deal to purchase Vector 1 Software for $6 billion. The company decided to make this purchase because of the fierce competition V1Soft had been creating, especially with artificial intelligence research and revolutionary game-making techniques. According to CEO Tim Cook,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We are very excited for this new addition to the Apple family. We will work with the wonderful people at Vector 1 Software to create technology and software that will improve all of your digital lives. This amazing new AI program we've created (with the help of V1Soft) has already predicted many things that will happen in the future, including the uncanny guess "Trump build wall"  from Bob, the most intelligent AI since the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's <em>Genuine People Personalities</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What Cook failed to mention is that all current programmers in V1Soft have one week to clear their offices and then they will be out of jobs. Though the former company members have earned six billion, they are still upset about the loss of their jobs.</p>

    <blockquote>  
      <p>"I <em>am</em> rich now," says Connor Haight, founder of Vector 1 Software, "but I'm still upset that I can't continue developing Bob. He was getting really good at predicting the future."</p>
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>Allan Burleson and Jaden Manacsa avoided the press and made no comment.</p>
